Project Description

Key Conservation is helping conservationists gain critical funding and global support through a mobile app that provides real-time updates on day-to-day campaigns.

We are wildlife biologists who saw a massive disconnect in the way we could reach out for real-time global support for critical needs outside our project's budget. We also knew conservation organizations all over the world were facing similar issues.

Additionally, supporters of conservation organizations want more transparency as to where their money is going, what the outcome of their support is, as well as, better ways to stay connected.

### Key Features

- Authentication with Auth0
- Conservation profiles to create campaigns
- Create/Update/Delete campaigns
- Supporter profiles to donate to campaigns

# APIs

## Auth0

Auth0 provides authentication and authorization as a service and includes a whole suite of products available to benefit owner/user/developer.

## Amplitude Analytics

Amplitude provides analytics for our app in a way that is easiest to work with Expo without having to eject.

We have setup a HOC to wrap desired components to have analytics. The component is called withAmplitude.js. There are functions in there as well that can be imported for easier and quicker use.
